# jsPlumb example

The library jsPlumb seems a nice library to do some block diagram visualizations in the browser. I use it as an opportunity to understand AngularJS. How do they both actually manipulate the DOM and how can I mix AngularJS with jQuery (for jsPlumb).

The two folders:

* jquery: the default trom the blog by [Emiel Hollander](http://blog.emielhollander.nl/2013/01/getting-started-with-jsplumb).
* angular: the changes to integrate with AngularJS.

## Usage

In the `scripts` directory there is a `run.sh` script, but seriously, you won't need it. It's a matter of opening the `index.html` file in the `jquery/` or `angular/` folder in your favorite browser.
